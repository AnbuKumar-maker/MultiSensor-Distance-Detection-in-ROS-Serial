Step 1 - Initiate ROS in Jetson Nano by executing the command roscore (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)

Step 2 - Open a new terminal to execuite the below command to establish ROSSerial communication between Jetson Nano and Arduino (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

Step 3 - To display the range of sensors activated you need to initiate the list in ROS, execute the below command (DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL)

rostopic list

Step 4 - To execute the output of each sensor one by one, execute the below command

Rrostopic echo /ultrasound_center
